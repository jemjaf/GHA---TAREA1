#About env varibles:
# When more than one environment variable is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific environment variable.

# S>J>W
# For example, an environment variable defined in a step will override job and workflow variables with the same name, while the step executes.

# S>J
# A variable defined for a step will override a job variable with the same name, while the step executes.

# J>W
# A variable defined for a job will override a workflow variable with the same name, while the job executes.
